# CarPhysics_sandbox

## Dependencies

Still have to setup dependencies properly in this repo; ANYWAY this code depends on:

- pyBox2D
- PyGame (for the GUI part)

## CarPhysics submodule

This code relies on another repository, CarPhysics. It is registered here as a submodule.

## Collision Benchmark

simply run collision_bench.py

### GUI mode
 
at line #61 set 
```
pygame_gui = True
```

### Benchmark headless mode

at line #61 set 
```
pygame_gui = False
```
